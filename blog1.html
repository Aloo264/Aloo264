  <h2>'Don't f**k with cats' on Netlix.</h2>
<p>I honestly didn’t expect a lot from this series. In my defence, who expects anything from a documentary? But boy did it make me press on “next episode” quicker than a hummingbird flap.
For those who know nothing about this series, here’s a quick spoiler-free summary:
A good looking dude wakes up one day to realise he’s a narcissistic douchebag and posts videos of him killing kittens on multiple social media for attention. He got what he wanted and suddenly people on the internet from multiple countries decided they wanted him behind bars. So they did with him exactly what you do with your crush’s social media. Stalker alert. But no, this stalking was actually to prevent (or fuel?) the making of a serial killer.  <br> <br>

The series is based on true events and it is a must watch for internet nerds and people wanting to be Sherlock. How they tracked down this mysterious kitten killer is pretty interesting and in the series, they also displayed multiple tools they used that helped them track down the psychotic idiot. I will not go to the details of the story but rather discuss the various tools and also some gruesome shock sites these were uploaded on.
<br> <br>
Also, doxxing is a fancy term for stalking, just in case. <br> <br>

1. TinEye.com
<br> <br>

TinEye is a website that allows you to upload a picture and then looks through more than 47 billion pictures online to see a match about where it has been uploaded before. By ‘where’ I mean the site where it has been uploaded before. It is a Canadian site so you can trust it when it says ‘we do not save your search images.’ Although they don’t apologise when they can’t find a match to your uploaded picture. Hmm… Not that Canadian, is it? <br> <br>

2.  EXIF data extraction <br> <br>

Exif data is the data that is present in any picture taken which can be extracted using some tools online like exifdata.com. The exif data can also give you the location of the place this picture was taken depending on several factors (e.g, the GPS/location of the device the pictures was taken with was on). One such site is pic2map.com. No guarantees that it will always deliver the results but worth a shot if you’re sitting behind a screen, hunting down a serial killer. <br> <br>

3.  Sherlock <br> <br>

This tool was not mentioned in the documentary but it’s a good doxxing tool. What you have to do after setting it up is enter the syntax along with a username you are stalking and when you hit enter, you see sites that have accounts with the same username. Although some of those sites are bogus as well, but not all. So good luck, who knows what else you may find the person? <br> <br>

4. Google maps street view <br> <br>

The doxxers tracking down the killer in the documentary used google maps frequently. They may spot a fuel station in a picture of their suspect and then based on it, use google to find out the name of that petrol station based on its colours, then from other info they had collected, go to Google maps street view of all the fuel stations in that location and find out the one that matches best with the person’s location in the picture. That’s how they figured out this man’s house. Scary what can be known about you with such little information to begin with. <br> <br>

5.  bestgore.com <br> <br>

This isn’t a doxxing tool, it was a shock site where real videos of disturbing violence including murder, rape, etc. were uploaded. This site was banned only last year (2020) in November.
This is the site where the kitten killer uploaded some of his murder videos. Believe me or not, this site is also Canadian. Global peace index, much? <br> <br>

6.  Liveleak.com <br> <br>

This was also a similar shock site where such disturbing images/videos were uploaded and one of them was the execution of Saddam Hussain. You get the idea. The killer uploaded videos on this site as well. It’s a British site (phew, Canada) which was recently banned on 7th May, 2021. Now the visitors are redirected to another website called itemfix.com which is also a video sharing site. <br> <br>
That’s all for now, I’m glad you took out time to read :) <br>
Have a good day!</p>
