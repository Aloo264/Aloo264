  <h2>'If there was a zombie apocalypse, I'd let my dog eat me' by LilyPichu </h2>
<p>This song has a different hit to it. Not only is this song a huge banger but its lyrics is so, so catchy that it makes me wanna loop the song up. Why though? <br> <br>

There’s something different about most people in our generation. We like different. We want to be different. We know about the norms of the past and most of us are not okay following them and there’s nothing wrong with that. If I look at humans with the eyes of an extraterrestrial being, I won’t hesitate before saying that humans need attention. Yeah, yeah, “I hate humans and I wish I could live alone for the rest of my life and never ever meet another person,” cut the crap. You wouldn’t say that if you didn’t want attention in the first place, so I’m sorry your attention visa is canceled. <br> <br>

Anyhow, we find new ways to gain attention, continuing to do something that hasn’t been done or perhaps recognised in the past. I said it before, I’ll say it again, doing something different isn’t doing something wrong unless you break the law or something. One such ‘different’ is dark humour. Making a joke out of a sensitive topic publicly made people go, “can we say that?” And hence this became another new thing to follow. Similar the case with depression. People were physically fit and realised that pain gains sympathy. Somehow every next person now has depression. Rocket science? I don’t think so. I’m not saying depression isn’t real or something, I’m just saying that people making it a trend makes it hard for the people who actually suffer from it to identify themselves out of this. They don’t ‘brag’ about having a messed up mental health. The thing is, when something different comes, people start following it to a point where it’s no longer different and then out of that is either born a new different or we open doors to the older trends. <br> <br>

How in the world did I go reminiscing about the human behaviour and its constant need for attention when I started off with the topic of a song? <br>
This song is different, perhaps a little uncomfortable for some people. It stands out of the usual song making concepts and I personally find this song amazing. I wouldn’t be surprised if this song becomes a new trend in a little while. Till then, I only hope such songs don’t become mainstream. Perhaps we’d have more credibility to give to an artist as an audience if they come up with their own idea of ‘different’ and don’t just copy another upcoming trends. That is, if they wanna be different. Nothing’s wrong with the classic approach. EDM came but I still prefer pop personally. <br> <br>

I’m glad you took time to read this. <br>
Have a good day ahead! :)</p>
